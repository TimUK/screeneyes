# ScreenEyes

This program is a tool to alert computer users when they should take a break - avoiding computer related issues such as eye strain, RSI, carpal tunnel, etc.

## Scope
The basic scope of this application is to have a basic system that will allow a user to be alerted every hour to take a 5 minute break. After 5 minutes, the hour of work timer will restart.

Building upon this basic functionality will be an implementation of the pomodoro timing technique and after that, users able to set their own work/break length.
